          <h3>Agile Project Management</h3>
          <p>For a lot of people agile is a buzzword that has lost all meaning.
            Agile is not just Scrum, but a whole philosophy that extends from
            scheduling into development best practices.</p>
          <p>Through a careful blend of Kanban,
            Scrum and eXtreme Programming we can help your team create a
            project management methodology that solves the problems you face
            every day and works for you, not against you.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h3>Development Best Practices</h3>
          <p>Software development should be about building high quality, useful
            and innovative solutions in an efficient manner. This is easier said
            than done but by following best practices these ideas become ingrained
            into the process from inception right through to delivery.</p>
          <p>We can help you to improve code quality and maintainability, spread
            knowledge throughout your team, improve and automate your
            infrastructure and tools and create a culture of innovation.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h3>Software Architecture</h3>
          <p>Web based software is much more complicated than it used to be. There
            are a huge number of technologies to choose from, new applications are
            expected to integrate into existing software and resilience and scalability
            are critical.</p>
          <p>We can guide you to select the most suitable technologies and advise on
            cloud and NoSQL database adoption. From here we can help you to design
            a clean and efficient architecture with a RESTful API.</p>
