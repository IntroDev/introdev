        <h3>Click Innovation <small>Technology Director</small></h3>

        <p>Tim continues to work with Click Innovation and acts as a non-executive
          Technology Director. In this role Tim guides the technical direction of the company
          and their CRM product, <a href="http://lighthouserocks.com">Lighthouse</a>.
          Whilst this is a strategic role, Tim believes that staying hands-on is the best
          way of keeping up to date and identifying areas for improvement. As such,
          he can often be found fixing bugs, refactoring or designing user interfaces
          between regular strategic meetings with colleagues or clients.</p>

        <p>After joining Click Innovation Tim managed a restructuring of the development
          department and built a team to develop a new SaaS CRM product.
          <a href="http://lighthouserocks.com">Lighthouse</a> CRM was to be built
          on new technologies whilst continuing to utilise development best practices.

          the product to market.</p>
        <p>Introducing some bold changes to team behaviour such as test-driven
          development and pair programming, Tim created a culture of innovation and attention
          to detail that proved to be beneficial to productivity, quality and team morale.</p>
