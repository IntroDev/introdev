        <h3>Try Catch Software <small>Managing Director</small></h3>

        <p>Tim set up Try Catch Software to help software companies become
        more effective by drawing on his years of experience managing development teams

        <h3>Click Innovation <small>Technology Director</small></h3>

        <p>As Technology Director Tim guides the technical direction of the company
          and their CRM product, <a href="http://lighthouserocks.com">Lighthouse</a>.
          Whilst a strategic role Tim believe that staying hands-on is the best
          way of keeping up to date and identifying
          areas for improvement. He regularly partakes in strategic meetings with
          colleagues and clients but can also be found fixing bugs, refactoring
          or designing user interfaces.</p>

        <p>Tim continues to work with Click Innovation and acts as a non-executive
          Technology Director.</p>

        <h3>Click Innovation <small>Development Manager</small></h3>

        <p>After joining Click Innovation Tim managed a restructuring of the development
          department and built a team to develop a new SaaS CRM product called
          <a href="http://lighthouserocks.com">Lighthouse</a>
          that was to be built on new technologies with development best practices.</p>
        <p>Tim architected and built large parts of the Lighthouse core and delivered
          the product to market. He also introduced some bold changes in team
          behaviour such as test-driven development and pair programming that
          proved to be beneficial to productivity, quality and team morale.
          Tim aimed to create a culture of innovation and attention to detail.</p>

          grew as more staff joined the team, requiring changes to the project
          management process. He managed the adoption of Scrum and later Kanban.</p>
